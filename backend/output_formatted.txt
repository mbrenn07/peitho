grow', '0:43': "and they're one of the easiest,\xa0\nbecause unlike say potatoes,", '0:47': 'the tubers can stay in here all\xa0\nwinter, to lift up as they are needed,', '0:51': 'at your convenience,

bounds\xa0\nand from becoming a bit of a nuisance.', '4:42': 'This area down here should be\xa0\nabsolutely perfect, it gets some shade,', '4:47': 'but importantly gets a bit more sun during

couple of barrow loads spread over the area.', '5:04': 'Jerusalem artichokes actually grow\xa0\nreally well even in poor soils,', '5:08': "but if you can improve it, well it's going to\xa0\ngive it extra oomph to get even more tubers.", '5:14': "Now let me show you what I've done, I've\xa0\nheld back some of the tubers to replant", '5:18': "and I've gone for nice, smooth tubers like\xa0\nthis

windy,', '8:44': 'hence their other nickname, the fartychoke.', '8:47': 'This is down to a dietary fiber\xa0\nin the tubers called inulin,', '8:52': 'but while it can have that\xa0\nunfortunate side effect,', '8:55': "it's actually very good for the old gut\xa0\nbiome and can improve digestive health.", '9:00': 'So in short, these are terribly good for us.', '9:04': 'Harvesting the tubers after a

onion", '9:42': 'and some garlic and ginger and some\xa0\nsalt to create a kind of briny solution.', '9:48': "And then, 'cause I like it a bit spicy,\xa0\nsome chili flakes and of course the salt.",
